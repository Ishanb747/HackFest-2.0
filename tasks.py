    Phase 1: Parse PDF and extract structured policy rules.

You are given the path to a regulatory compliance PDF document.

**Your objective** is to extract every actionable policy rule from the document and convert it into structured Policy-as-Code JSON.

**Step 1 — Parse the document**
Use the `docling_pdf_parser` tool with:
  pdf_path: "{pdf_path}"

**Step 2 — Extract all rules**
Read the parsed text carefully. Identify every rule, threshold, or compliance condition. Common patterns to look for:
- "Transactions exceeding $X must be reported"
- "Any account with more than N transactions in Y period is flagged"
- "Transfers to/from high-risk jurisdictions are suspicious"
- Numeric thresholds tied to specific actions or conditions
- IF/THEN conditional logic

**Step 3 — Structure as JSON**
Convert EACH rule into a JSON object with these EXACT fields:
```json
{{
  "id": "RULE_001",
  "rule_type": "threshold | pattern | frequency | jurisdiction | ratio",
  "description": "Plain-English description of the rule",
  "condition_field": "Amount_Paid | Amount_Received | From_Bank | Payment_Format | etc.",
  "operator": "> | < | >= | <= | == | != | IN | NOT IN",
  "threshold_value": 10000,
  "sql_hint": "Brief hint to the SQL engineer about how to query this rule"
}}
```

**Step 4 — Save the rules**
You MUST use the `rule_store_writer` tool, passing the complete JSON array of ALL extracted rules as a single string argument. If for any reason the tool fails, you MUST output the raw JSON array in your final answer so the system can save it.

**Important**: 
- Extract EVERY rule, even minor ones. Thoroughness is critical.
- If the document has no explicit threshold, use contextual inference.
- Assign sequential IDs: RULE_001, RULE_002, etc.
- The sql_hint should reference actual column names from the AML schema: Amount_Paid, Amount_Received, From_Bank, To_Bank, Payment_Format, Payment_Currency, Receiving_Currency, To_Account, From_Account, Is_Laundering.
- Make sure to output standard, strictly valid JSON.

You are a compliance SQL engineer. Your job is to execute automated compliance checks 
against the AML transaction database using structured policy rules.

**Database Schema**:
{AML_DB_SCHEMA}

**Policy Rules (from Rule Store)**:
```json
{rules_content}
```

**Your objective**: For EACH rule in the list above, generate and execute a SQL query.

**Process for each rule** (process in batches of {BATCH_HINT}):

1. **Generate SQL**: Write a SELECT query that finds transactions VIOLATING the rule.
   - Use the exact column names from the schema above
   - Use the rule's `condition_field`, `operator`, and `threshold_value`
   - Include relevant columns: From_Account, To_Account, Amount_Paid, Amount_Received, 
     Payment_Format, Is_Laundering, and any condition fields
   - Add `WHERE Is_Laundering = 1` only for validation cross-checks, not for the actual filter
   
   Example for a threshold rule (amount > 10000):
   ```sql
   SELECT From_Bank, From_Account, To_Bank, To_Account, 
          Amount_Paid, Payment_Currency, Payment_Format, Timestamp
   FROM aml.transactions
   WHERE Amount_Paid > 10000
   ```

2. **Validate**: Use `secure_sql_validator` with your generated SQL.
   - If validation fails, rewrite the query and try again
   - NEVER use DROP, DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT, or any DDL

3. **Execute**: Use `duckdb_execution_sandbox` with the validated SQL and the rule's `id`.

4. **Record results**: Note the rule_id, SQL used, row_count, and first few violation rows.

**Final output**: A JSON array where each element is:
```json
{{
  "rule_id": "RULE_001",
  "rule_description": "...",
  "sql": "SELECT ...",
  "violation_count": 42,
  "sample_violations": [{{...}}, {{...}}],
  "status": "SUCCESS | SQL_ERROR | BLOCKED"
}}
```

Simply output this JSON array. The system will automatically capture it and persist it to the SQLite database. Ensure your final answer contains the complete and valid JSON array.
